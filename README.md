# MDXy

Tu se możemy wykreślać co jest done, czy coś xD

It is necessary to use in MDX queries (at least once): 

calculated member, - DONE

WHERE clause, - DONE

MDX function operating on the dimension hierarchy, - emm, using .Children but guess we're gonna use it in DATE somehow

Top... or Bottom... function - DONE

and a numerical operation. - done... i guess

If the queries defined in the first point do not fulfill 
requirements defined in the second points it is needed to 
formulate additional queries fulfilling the requirements.
