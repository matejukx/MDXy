# MDXy

Tu se możemy wykreślać co jest done, czy coś xD

It is necessary to use in MDX queries (at least once): calculated member, WHERE
clause, MDX function operating on the dimension hierarchy, Top... or Bottom...
function and a numerical operation. If the queries defined in the first point do not
fulfill requirements defined in the second points it is needed to formulate additional
queries fulfilling the requirements.
